# Student-class-cplusplus
This covers basic calculation and data for students in university


You have to create a Class named Student. For each student we want to store his/her Roll Number, Name, Batch,
number of registered courses, course codes, course names, course grades, CGPA, Degree, and Date of Birth. You will
need to write three files (Student.h, Student.cpp and Q1.cpp)
Your implemented class must fully provide the definitions of following class (interface) functions. Please also write
down the test code to drive your class implementation. Please note that we will be running your code against our test
code and any segmentation faults or incorrect result will result in loss of marks.
